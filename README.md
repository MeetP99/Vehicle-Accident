-> Designed and developed a cutting-edge vehicle accident avoidance system using Arduino Uno and GSM module, integrating multiple sensors including alcohol, eye blink, and vibration sensors 

-> Created and deployed an advanced algorithm based on driver's eye blink rate and alcohol level to detect signs of fatigue and impaired driving; system seamlessly tracked and relayed live parameter data and location information to authorized parties for timely intervention. 

-> Orchestrated the deployment of real-time data on AWS IoT Core using the MQTT protocol, enabling precise tracking and analysis of data within designated time frames, resulting in a 40% improvement in operational efficiency.
